tiled-wallpaper-archive
-----------------------

This is a pet project to collect as many old tiling wallpapers that I can, from various sources.

Some are pulled from other archives, some are pulled directly from releases of old OS iso images.

I've not put much time into organizing them or creating a unified filename structure, and at this
time I have no plans to. Just load them up with nitrogen or a similar app, and choose one from the
thumbnails.
